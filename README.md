This repository contains the resources and documentation for my network & systems engineering lab environment, which I use to develop skills in new industry topics.

The information in this repository is subject to change at any time since it is used for practice.

## Where can I find the documentation?

Please refer to the Wiki tab for documentation, and the Code tab for any reference files, which will be added as time goes on.
