# Independent Skills Development Environment
This repository contains the resources and documentation for my skills-development server environment, which I use to learn new services, applications and other topics via Proxmox self-hosting.
## Where do I see your documentation?
Please refer to the Wiki tab for documentation, and the Code tab for any reference files, which will be added as time goes on.
